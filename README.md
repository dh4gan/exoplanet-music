This Python repo creates music, where each exoplanet creates a note based on:

i) The period of the planet (how often the note is played)

ii) The radius of the planet (the pitch of the note, and amplitude)

This code relies on the `wavebender` module to generate tones and save them to wave files:

Exoplanet data taken from a local copy of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue
(Also note that the scripts store a machine dependent directory for the catalogue!)
